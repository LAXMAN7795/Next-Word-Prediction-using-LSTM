##Next Word Prediction using LSTM
This project implements a next-word prediction model using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural networks in Python. The model is trained on a text dataset and predicts the next word given a sequence of words.

Features
Preprocessing of text data
Tokenization and sequence generation
LSTM-based neural network for prediction
Training and evaluation scripts
Easy-to-use interface for making predictions
Setup
Clone the repository:


git clone https://github.com/LAXMAN7795/Next-Word-Prediction-using-LSTM.gitcd Next-Word-Prediction-using-LSTM
Create a Conda environment:


conda create -p ./venv python=3.11 -yconda activate ./venv
Install dependencies:


pip install -r requirements.txt
Usage
Run the main application:


python app.py
Modify app.py to change dataset or model parameters as needed.
