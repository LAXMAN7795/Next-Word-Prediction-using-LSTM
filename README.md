Next Word Prediction using LSTM
A deep learning project for predicting the next word in a sequence using LSTM neural networks.

Overview
This repository contains code for building and training an LSTM-based model to predict the next word given a sequence of words. The project demonstrates text preprocessing, sequence generation, model training, and prediction using Python and popular machine learning libraries.

Features
Text data preprocessing and tokenization
Sequence generation for training
LSTM neural network implementation
Model training and evaluation
Easy-to-use prediction interface
Getting Started
1. Clone the repository

git clone https://github.com/LAXMAN7795/Next-Word-Prediction-using-LSTM.gitcd Next-Word-Prediction-using-LSTM
2. Create and activate a Conda environment

conda create -p ./venv python=3.11 -yconda activate ./venv
3. Install dependencies

pip install -r requirements.txt
4. Run the application

python app.py
File Structure
app.py — Main script for training and prediction
requirements.txt — List of required Python packages
.gitignore — Excludes venv and other unnecessary files
Customization
